# AI- LEARNING
## Task 2

Perceptron learning (machine learning)

DATA - IRIS (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris)

Two datasets:
1)a) SETOSA (50 data points)
b) VERSICOLOR and VIRGINICA (100 data points)

2)a) VERSICOLOR (50 data points)
b) VIRGINICA (50 data points)

Labels are 0 or 1

Create a program that teaches one neuron (perceptron) for classification tasks.
**TESTING IS MANDATORY**, for this the data set should be split into a training and testing set. The ratio of the sets should be either 80:20 or 70:30

probably use sklearn?


You should be able to read the data from file
You should be able to change parameters. For example learning rate, iteration number
There should be two activation function: BIAS and Sigmoid
