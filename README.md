## Picture classification using convolutional neural network

## Data

Data used is [CIFAR](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)

#### Tasks:
- Prepare data for neural network
- Convoluted neural network implementation (Usable packages: TensorFlow, Keras, Jupyter Notebook)
- In the implementation, there should be a possibility to: 
 - Change the architecture
 - Change hyperparameters (Activation function, epochs and iterations, batch size, optimization algorithm, loss function)
 - Change aktivation function
 - Select the ratio of training and testing sets
 - Evaluate classification accuracy
 - Calculate *Confusion matrix*

#### Answer to these questions:
- How do the results depend on the network architecture?
- how do the results depend on the hyperparameter values?
*P.S Evaluate the results using classifation accuracy*
